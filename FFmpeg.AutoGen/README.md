##FFmpeg.AutoGen [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Ruslan-B/FFmpeg.AutoGen.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Ruslan-B/FFmpeg.AutoGen)

FFmpeg auto generated unsafe bindings for C#/.NET and Mono.  
The bindings are generated for FFmpeg 3.0.

##Usage

The basic example of the library usage: video decoding, conversion and frame extraction to jpeg is included in ```FFmpeg.AutoGen.Example``` project.  
For the more sophisticated operations please refer to offical [ffmpeg Documentation](https://www.ffmpeg.org/documentation.html) expecially API section of it.

- on Windows:  
Native ffmpeg binaries are pre bundled in the repository. 
The binaries source from [Zeranoe FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/).
Please check to example project it shows how specify path to libraries.  

- on OS X:  
Install ffmpeg via [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org):
```bash
sudo port install ffmpeg +universal
```
Please make sure that ```FFmpeg.AutoGen.dll``` coupled with ```FFmpeg.AutoGen.config``` and all paths are correct. 
By default MacPorts keeps compiled libraries in ```/opt/local/lib```.

- on Linux:  
You need to update ```FFmpeg.AutoGen.config``` with full path to FFmpeg libraries.

##Generation

The bindings generator uses [clangsharp](http://www.clangsharp.org).

Prerequisites:
 - FFmpeg library include files ```./ffmpeg/include```

Steps to generate:
- Run FFmpeg.AutoGen.ClangSharpUnsafeGenerator;
- All files with extension ```*.g.cs```  in ```FFmpeg.AutoGen``` project will be regenerated.
